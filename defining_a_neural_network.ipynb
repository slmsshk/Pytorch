        "\n# Defining a Neural Network in PyTorch\nDeep learning uses artificial neural networks (models), which are\ncomputing systems that are composed of many layers of interconnected\nunits. By passing data through these interconnected units, a neural\nnetwork is able to learn how to approximate the computations required to\ntransform inputs into outputs. In PyTorch, neural networks can be\nconstructed using the ``torch.nn`` package.\n\n## Introduction\nPyTorch provides the elegantly designed modules and classes, including\n``torch.nn``, to help you create and train neural networks. An\n``nn.Module`` contains layers, and a method ``forward(input)`` that\nreturns the ``output``.\n\nIn this recipe, we will use ``torch.nn`` to define a neural network\nintended for the [MNIST\ndataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#mnist)_.\n\n## Setup\nBefore we begin, we need to install ``torch`` if it isn\u2019t already\navailable.\n\n::\n\n   pip install torch\n"

        "### 2. Define and intialize the neural network\n\nOur network will recognize images. We will use a process built into\nPyTorch called convolution. Convolution adds each element of an image to\nits local neighbors, weighted by a kernel, or a small matrix, that\nhelps us extract certain features (like edge detection, sharpness,\nblurriness, etc.) from the input image.\n\nThere are two requirements for defining the ``Net`` class of your model.\nThe first is writing an ``__init__`` function that references\n``nn.Module``. This function is where you define the fully connected\nlayers in your neural network.\n\nUsing convolution, we will define our model to take 1 input image\nchannel, and output match our target of 10 labels representing numbers 0\nthrough 9. This algorithm is yours to create, we will follow a standard\nMNIST algorithm.\n\n\n"
